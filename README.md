### E-Commerce-Store Backend



### Deployment Notes for Heroku

* This is for a backend that has been initialized with express-generator.
* Create a new file ./.env and add following environment variable
```javascript
PORT=4000
```
* Install nodemon on the server and add custom dev command.
* > npm i nodemon
```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "start": "PORT=4000 node ./bin/www",
    "dev": "PORT=4000 nodemon ./bin/www"
  },
```
* Install CORS package if not already done.
* > npm i cors
```javascript
const cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors());
app.options("*", cors());
```

* Make sure you git commit all changes before beginning.
* Download Heroku CLI if not done already.
* Login to Heroku - make sure you have an account.
* > heroku login
* > press any key and should take you to login
* Once logged in type in command to create a remote 
* > heroku create -a app-name
* Make sure to not name the heroku app the same as git repository
* The heroku create CLI command creates a new empty application on Heroku, along with an associated empty Git repository. If you run this command from your appâ€™s root directory, the empty Heroku Git repository is automatically set as a remote for your local repository.
* > git remote -v to show both 
* Save in .env file
